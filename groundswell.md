## The Vision

*Through communication, creativity, and connection, Groundswell fosters a culture where the emotional complexities of oncology care are acknowledged, isolation transforms into belonging, and self-care is honored as essential to delivering excellent patient care.*

Groundswell is a grant-funded ecosystem of emotional support for healthcare workers, developed in collaboration with the Gynecologic Oncology staff at UPMC Magee-Womens Hospital.

In an era where healthcare worker well-being has been systematically neglected, Groundswell stands apart as a deeply relational design initiative that confronts a profound truth: caring for patients begins with caring for the people who serve them. Rather than imposing solutions from outside, Groundswell amplifies the existing culture of care that staff had already created—repositioning the project as an act of recognition, not intervention.

This multi-dimensional ecosystem addresses caregiver well-being through interconnected touchpoints across four dimensions: operational, physical, emotional, and cultural. The approach reframes burnout from an individual failure to an institutional responsibility, creating systemic solutions that make compassionate care sustainable.

The project has secured over $30,000 in material donations, launched a 12-month quality improvement study, and generated a research paper currently in review exploring "resonance" as a design value in co-creation.

## The Ecosystem

Groundswell is designed to meet staff wherever they are in their day. Each component connects to different moments—patient loss, hard days, breaks, one-on-one conversations—creating multiple pathways to support rather than a single intervention.

## The Work

*Named for water that rises naturally from deep within the earth, Groundswell emerges directly from the efforts and voices of healthcare workers themselves.*

The ecosystem comprises four interconnected components—each addressing a different dimension of workplace well-being. Together, they create the conditions for culture change to emerge from within the care community.

### Ceased to Breathe Email Redesign

Updated patient death notification email template with compassionate visuals and language that acknowledges the impact of patient loss.

What we initially saw as a cold clinical protocol was actually a staff-created innovation—a radical act of compassion one nurse manager had built to ensure colleagues learned about patient deaths with dignity. This revelation shifted our entire approach: from "the system has let you down" to "you have already created a beautiful culture of care." Groundswell honors and amplifies what was already there.

### Groundswell Restorative Pod

A dedicated space for emotional decompression through mindfulness activities like guided meditation.

We heard that staff save their tears for the car ride home or the bathroom stall—a process that takes away from their quality time with loved ones. Almost everyone we spoke to commented on the physical environment as an opportunity for improvement. Nestled in a space that once housed telephone booths, the pod invites staff to take a moment to restore, reinforcing the message that emotional labor is real work deserving of real space.

### Groundswell Reflection Cards

Guided reflection cards that help staff build a self-care practice through emotional validation and introductory exercises for emotional regulation.

By showing healthcare workers that the full spectrum of grief includes complex and contradictory emotions, the cards help create a more holistic culture of care. The combination of emotional identification, validation, and somatic exercises makes this a powerful tool for connection with self and others. Every staff member received their own deck; one set permanently lives in the pod.

### Groundswell Garden

A community art wall that invites participation through anonymous shared emotional expression across the full spectrum of oncology experiences.

We intentionally included family caregivers and patients because we saw how important it was for staff to hear from them—especially gratitude, as almost every desk was decorated with cards from patients and families. Staff reported discomfort expressing feelings due to fear of retaliation. We built this as an anonymous place to safely share and understand what others are feeling—giving public, collective voice to the cancer care community.

## The Voices

> "A special person can do this work forever, a good person can do it for a little while, most people couldn't do it for a day."
> — Oncology Staff

We invited 30 participants to test the pod experience before installing at the hospital. Participants said:

> "It's remarkable what 10 minutes can do..."

> "As soon as I stepped inside, I almost teared up. You're not always aware of how frazzled you are until you stop."

> "Being able to stop in the middle of the day and have the physical and mental space to get quiet and meditate is really helpful—much better than a bathroom stall."

> "You don't have to wait until the end of the day to refresh, but you can have micro-resets in-between."

> "I've worked in the trauma field, and I work with physicians... everyone needs one of these."

## The Outcomes

*Groundswell is now officially installed at UPMC Magee-Womens Hospital, launching a 12-month quality improvement study for Cancer Services staff.*

We are tracking engagement across every dimension of the ecosystem—pod utilization, art wall contributions, meditation resource usage, and digital engagement. A custom data visualization dashboard is being developed to surface patterns in how staff interact with Groundswell over time, currently undergoing iterative feedback.

[Screen recording: dashboard autoplay — placeholder until recorded]

### Impact (first four months)

570 — points of engagement
207 — emotion responses
256 — pod visits
107 — meditation views

*Minimum baselines—our methods are designed to undercount rather than overcount.*

The qualitative richness of the emotion responses, combined with consistent pod usage patterns, suggests meaningful adoption by staff seeking moments of respite in their workday.

The study combines quantitative data with qualitative interviews conducted by our team throughout the pilot, measuring compassion fatigue, burnout, culture of employee well-being, and intent to leave—before, during, and after the installation.

### What's ahead

- Ongoing qualitative surveys and data collection
- A research paper on designing for "resonance" in healthcare, currently in review
- Pursuing grant funding to expand Groundswell into additional hospital settings

## The Context

*How might we create supportive environments where staff can feel nurtured, recognized, and celebrated?*

Healthcare workers face a dual burden: the inherently compassionate nature of their work—constant exposure to grief, loss, and trauma—combined with excessive administrative tasks that disconnect them from their original purpose of patient care.

We learned about the phenomenon of "chronic compounded grief" among oncology nurses, and how repeated exposure to loss accumulates over time when not properly processed. Over 1 in 5 healthcare workers in the U.S. have experienced PTSD. 73% of emergency physicians report stigma around mental health treatment in their workplace, with 27% avoiding treatment entirely due to fear of professional consequences.

This is not an individual failure. It is a systemic one.

## The Research

*Through trust-building, observational and generative research, rapid ideation, and feedback sessions, our team developed the first iteration of the Groundswell concept.*

We spent 15 weeks embedded with the Gynecologic Oncology staff at Magee—shadowing nurses during shifts, conducting in-depth interviews, and designing participatory activities that invited staff to share what they often couldn't say out loud.

### Shadowing & Interviews

We observed the windowless environment, the cramped desks, the constant interruptions. We sat with people in quiet moments and heard stories of skipping meals, saving tears for the car ride home, and funerals attended alone. We interviewed 8 staff members across roles to understand how grief management varies—some compartmentalize during commutes, others prefer talking through emotions with trusted colleagues.

### Women in White Coats Event

We partnered with CancerBridges to conduct generative research with female leaders in oncology. Participants added their thoughts to an orchid poster—a symbolic flower in cancer care—exploring how their approach to patient care has evolved to balance compassion and self-care.

### Nourishing the Flower Workshop

Staff completed worksheets using nature-based metaphors to identify the "nutrients" and "root causes" of a nourished workplace. Key themes emerged: recognition matters, supportive environments are essential, and strong team culture makes the work sustainable.

### Grief Workshop

We created a container for vulnerability—opening with a trauma-responsive grounding exercise, providing a soft stuffed animal to hold for comfort, and facilitating scenario-based discussions about what colleagues could say or do to support a teammate who is struggling. One participant said, "We need more time with you guys!"—highlighting the hunger for dedicated space to process this aspect of their work.

## The Synthesis

*Our research revealed a powerful tension at the center of oncology work—what we came to call "The Void."*

We organized hundreds of observations and quotes through affinity mapping, searching for patterns across recognition, environment, culture, and systemic issues. This led us to develop a tetrahedron analysis that mapped the relationships between these interconnected forces.

At the center sat The Void: the unspoken emotional weight that healthcare workers carry when patient-centered systems neglect worker well-being. Staff feel caught between their deep compassion for patients and a system that treats their own needs as an afterthought.

Our core thesis emerged: rather than adding more burden to already-overwhelmed staff, Groundswell should create space—physical, emotional, and cultural—for what was already trying to surface. The most meaningful support would emerge from within the care community itself.

Three key insights guided our design:

1. Recognition matters — feeling appreciated through verbal affirmations and acknowledgment
2. Supportive environments — flexible workplaces with adequate resources and comfortable spaces
3. Strong team culture — collaboration, shared purpose, and kindness

## The Making

*This was my first experience with design production and launch in the real world. The rapid nature of the timeline made it a unique exercise in project management, stakeholder navigation, and creative problem-solving.*

Upon receiving grant funding and material donations, we embarked on a 10-week sprint to turn a high-fidelity concept into a functional prototype. As a small but mighty team of 3, we iterated on the brand, the ecosystem flow, the service design of the program, the interior design of the pod, the mindfulness resources, and the communications plan for hospital administration.

### The Language Shift

Staff feedback led us to shift away from "grief" and focus on "restoration." One physician explained, "Oncology work involves more than grief. It encompasses hope, joy, exhaustion, and resilience." The word grief narrowed the focus; restoration encompassed the broader movement of healthcare worker well-being. Our tagline evolved from "Making Space for Grief, Together" to "Making Space to Restore, Together." This subtle shift permeated every design component.

### Trust, Not Surveillance

The biggest challenge was navigating hospital regulations—including a last-minute request to add doors with locks to the pod. What initially seemed like a bureaucratic constraint became a creative catalyst. When administration proposed a key-card system to monitor access, we pushed back: care must include the freedom to pause without guilt or stigma. What began as a conversation about institutional compliance evolved into one about emotional safety. The final design features an acrylic facade that feels both protective and permeable, with LED lights that subtly signal use—creating a quiet, living presence within the hospital's rhythm.

### Building the Network

Working mostly remote, I spent this phase crafting copy, coordinating the project, and conducting donor outreach. I secured the donation of the pod itself from NookPod—a $13,000 value—and collaborated with meditation teachers Catherine Liggett and Mark Staley to create custom guided meditations and a poem for the project. Through partnerships, we received donations of wood, woodworking, finger labyrinths, printing costs, data sensors, high-tech door locks, and more.

Our incredible fabricator Greg Baltus transformed spatial limitations into design assets, building out and customizing the pod experience. As he noted, "This project emphasizes how, through considered design and collaboration, formerly underutilized areas of facilities can be energized to support the needs of healthcare workers."

## The Reflection

*When design meets systems change and is rooted in relationships, outcomes become more than products—they become symbols of collaboration and seeds planted for better futures.*

Looking back, three interdependent practices enabled us to achieve meaningful impact within institutional constraints:

**Presence** — sustained relational engagement over time. Without the two-year relationship between Professor Hughes and the UPMC team, none of this would have been possible. We didn't arrive as outsiders with solutions. We showed up, listened, and stayed.

**Attunement** — responsive listening across diverse perspectives. When staff told us "grief" was the wrong word, we listened. When a nurse revealed that the Ceased to Breathe email was her innovation, we reframed our entire narrative. Attunement meant trusting community wisdom over designer instincts.

**Harmonization** — amplifying existing community innovations rather than replacing them. Groundswell didn't introduce something foreign. It gave form and voice to what was already trying to surface from within the care community.

Together, these practices cultivated what we describe as resonance—the degree to which a design aligns with community needs, values, and capacities such that people recognize themselves in it, trust it, and nurture it. At launch, a member of the maintenance team volunteered to clean the pod. When design resonates, people across roles choose to nurture it.

Through Groundswell, I found a passion for healthcare design and participatory research. I learned how to attune my design process to amplify rather than impose—an experience that has shaped how I approach every project since.

### Donors & Contributors [collapsible, closed by default]

Groundswell would not exist without an extraordinary community of artisans and donors. The restorative pod was made possible by NookPod's gift of the structure; Greg Baltus and Hardware Assembly's remarkable design, engineering, and fabrication skills; and components from Schlage, Density, Dixie&Grace, Z9 Machinings, and EHC Industries. Ryan Thompson crafted the walnut tabletop from wood donated by Eleanor Mackie Pigma. The project's meditations are brought to life by the voices of Catherine Liggett and Mark Staley, who gave their time, voices, and hearts to this work. Carolyn Gavin's artwork became the visual thread unifying all program components. Generous donations from Deborah Linhart, Pamela Meadowcroft, and Marge Petruska enabled us to distribute a set of restorative cards to every employee participating in the study. Kevin Lorenzi provided photography. Special thanks to Mark Baskinger for creative support and encouragement.

We acknowledge that Groundswell could not have emerged without the deep trust-building between previous cohorts, Professor Kristin Hughes, and the UPMC staff. This version is intended as a first iteration. We hope to have the privilege to continue, improve, and expand based on the study's findings.

Our poem was inspired by Joy Harjo's work "Remember."

To everyone who played a role in bringing this project to life—thank you.
