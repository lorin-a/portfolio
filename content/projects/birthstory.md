## Context

A sister app concept to Myana (Mothers You Are Not Alone), developed in a graduate studio collaboration between CMU, Dezudio design studio founders, and the University of Pittsburgh Center for Research on Healthcare.

## Tension

Birthing parents lack systems of support before, during, and after the experience of giving birth, which is often overshadowed by the needs of a newborn.

How might we create an app that will help birthing parents and their loved ones prepare to document, record, and reflect on the process of giving birth in such a way that balances the logistical and emotional aspects of the experience?

## Listen

We interviewed 7 parents to learn about their birth experiences, and many reported that their experiences were traumatic and that they lacked tools to process them.

## Sense

[Add synthesis content]

## Imagine

Users are quickly onboarded with clear examples and can toggle between notes and journal entries in a chronological timeline. Thoughtful prompts guide reflection on the birth experience, while keyword tagging enables easy search.

## Try

We created lo-fi wireframes that attempted to offer as many tools as possible but through feedback we learned that simple is better for postpartum brain fog.

## Offer

[Add final design content]

## Learn

The concepts presented in this class will function as real, preliminary research and ideation for the eventual creation of a Birth Story app by the professors and the client.

If I could do this project again, I'd begin by simplifying. Identifying the core need early would have helped me stay focused, rather than trying to do too much at once.
