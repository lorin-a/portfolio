## Context

During my 3-month research assistantship with Carnegie Mellon's CREATE Lab within the Robotics Institute, I contributed wireframes to improve the back-end teacher experience of the MindfulNest app's dashboard.

## Tension

The MindfulNest App's first iteration has been a success and is ready for UX improvements. Teachers have expressed a desire for more features on the back-end.

How might we balance the needs of teachers and students without creating additional burdens for often overwhelmed educators?
