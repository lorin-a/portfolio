## Context

Groundswell is a grant-funded ecosystem of emotional support for healthcare workers, developed in collaboration with the Gynecologic Oncology staff at UPMC Magee-Womens Hospital.

Named for water that rises naturally from deep within the earth, Groundswell emerges directly from the efforts and voices of healthcare workers themselves while introducing approachable resources that acknowledge the emotional complexities of oncology care.

## Tension

How might we create supportive environments tailored for the well-being of healthcare staff, enabling them to openly and safely discuss and express concerns such as burnout, compassion fatigue, the emotional toll of patient deaths, and the increasing frustration arising from administrative tasks overshadowing patient care?

## Listen

We learned about the phenomenon of "chronic compounded grief" among oncology nurses, and how repeated exposure to loss accumulates over time when not properly processed.

The biggest frustrations centered on lack of recognition despite hard work, inadequate resources including insufficient space for both work and decompression, and toxic workplace dynamics that create burnout and affect patient care.

> "A special person can do this work forever, a good person can do it for a little while, most people couldn't do it for a day."

Through trust-building, observational and generative research, rapid ideation, and feedback sessions our team developed the first iteration of the Groundswell concept.

## Sense

The research revealed that healthcare workers at Magee are eager for dedicated spaces to process grief. Participants requested more time for such discussions and showed that grief management varies widely. Some compartmentalize during commutes while others prefer talking through emotions with trusted colleagues.

Key patterns emerged:

- Recognition matters: feeling appreciated through verbal affirmations and acknowledgment
- Supportive environments: flexible workplaces with adequate resources and comfortable spaces
- Strong team culture: collaboration, shared purpose, and kindness

## Imagine

Through communication, creativity, and connection, Groundswell fosters a culture where the emotional complexities of oncology care are acknowledged, isolation transforms into belonging, and self-care is honored as essential to delivering excellent patient care.

![gs-imagine-concept-01.jpg]

We envisioned a multi-level integrated system:

- Updated patient death notification email template with compassionate visuals and language
- A restorative pod space for emotional decompression and restoration
- A community art wall that invites participation through shared emotional expression
- Guided reflection cards for building a self-care practice

## Try

Upon receiving grant funding and material donations, we faced new limitations and constraints. The concept evolved through partnership and iteration.

![gs-try-production-01.jpg]

We navigated hospital approval processes, coordinated fabrication with Greg Baltus, conducted donor outreach securing over $30k in donations, and adapted to last-minute requests including doors with locks for the pod space.

Staff feedback led us to shift away from "grief" and focus on "restoration" because the word grief narrows the focus whereas restoration encompasses the broader movement of healthcare worker well-being.

![gs-try-playtesting-01.jpg]

We invited 30 participants to test our pod experience at CMU before installing at the hospital.

> "It's remarkable what 10 minutes can do..."

> "As soon as I stepped inside, I almost teared up. You're not always aware of how frazzled you are until you stop."

> "I've worked in the trauma field, and I work with physicians… everyone needs one of these."

## Offer

Community art wall that invites participation through anonymous shared emotional expression across the full spectrum of oncology experiences.

## Learn

Groundswell is now officially installed at Magee-Womens and launched for Cancer Services staff in October 2025, kickstarting a 12-month research study.

The project continues to evolve. We are developing a data visualization dashboard, have submitted a research paper on designing for "resonance," and are seeking grant funding to continue and democratize this work.

Three practices enabled partial movement toward relational design despite institutional constraints:

- **Presence**: sustained relational engagement over time
- **Attunement**: responsive listening across diverse perspectives
- **Harmonization**: amplifying existing community innovations

Together, these practices cultivated resonance—the degree to which a design aligns with community needs, values, and capacities such that people recognize themselves in it, trust it, and nurture it.
