## Context

A comprehensive rebranding proposal for the Great Allegheny Passage featuring a campaign for inexperienced riders, GPS app prototype, printed materials, and environmental graphics.

## Tension

Pittsburgh has a large transient student population and most residents are unaware of the GAP trail or experience barriers to experiencing this historic nature trail.

How might we rebrand the GAP trail to feel accessible and inviting to people with minimal experience in nature?
