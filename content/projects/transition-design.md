## Context

Transition Design is a systems-based, trans-disciplinary approach that tackles complex "wicked" problems by targeting root causes and steering society toward sustainable, equitable futures through intentional, place-based transformation.

This seminar project examines Pittsburgh's food insecurity through multiple transition design perspectives, proposing a hyper-local integrated intervention plan to dismantle systemic barriers to food security.

## Tension

Food insecurity affects approximately 12.5% of Pittsburgh's population, disproportionately impacting vulnerable groups including low-income individuals, elderly residents, single parents, children, and marginalized communities who face the systemic inequalities of "food apartheid."
